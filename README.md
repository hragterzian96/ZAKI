Zaki system uses a combination of wifi connected arduino, “nodes”, and a raspberry pi, “Controller”, to automate anything that is controlled with a switch or infrared remote. The Zaki source code and nodes schematic will be available as open source for anyone with the curiosity of smart home to be able to automate his house cheaply. Cost of the project will vary according to the size of the house and the number of nodes needed: Cost of raspberry pi: 70$, Cost per node: 10$.
